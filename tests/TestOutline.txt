On the first line put the name of the simulation: Game of Life, Percolation, Spreading Fire, Segregation
The second line should have three, space separated integers: #parametersToBeSpecified #rows #cols
The next #rows lines should have #cols space, separated integers that specify state, you can just 0, 1, 2 etc because I
add the offset in the logic that will turn 0 into 1200 and 1 into 1201 etc.
The next #parametersToBeSpecified should contain one word such as probCatch and the double value you want to set that
parameter to.  The tester will put the string specified into a map as the key and the double as its value.  You may need
 to change how you get the information from the map in your actual cell implementation.

Here is an example:
Spreading Fire
1 5 5
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
probCatch 1.0
