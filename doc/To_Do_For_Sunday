1. Add the errors to be thrown when checking arguments passed to methods
2. Talk about the use of boolean empty in Cell and the isEmpty function and how we want to deal with empty cells.
    * We could create an Empty state in the enums - I like how Dima used this in Segregation cell I think it might be
    the way to go
        * Pros: Don't need a new kind of cell, easy to right is empty function for all cells
        * Cons: Need to add an empty state for each of the simulations that support empty cells
            * This con may be unavoidable so it may be worth it
    * We could use an empty boolean flag
3. Can we delete the GamePlayer class now?  It was more just for getting started
4. Anna, how do we actually make the simulation happen? Do we ever actually use the .simulate methods or just
updateGrid?
5. What role are the simulation classes actually serving? Should we get rid of them
