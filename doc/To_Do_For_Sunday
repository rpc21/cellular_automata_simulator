1. Add the errors to be thrown when checking arguments passed to methods

4. Anna, how do we actually make the simulation happen? Do we ever actually use the .simulate() methods or just
updateGrid? If we don't use .simulate() we should get rid of the methods
7. Authors of the files?
8. More thorough commenting




--------------------------------------What is the role of Simulation------------------------------------------------
1. Simulation may be more valuable for Wator and Segregation because some parameters such as % fish or % empty are more
simulation-level parameters than cell-level parameters (in my head), these parameters are also important when
initializing the grid which is done by the simulation
