Cell Society Plan
===================

# Introduction
## Problem
    * We will create an interface that allows user to predict, model, and interact 
    with complex trends in human behavior and natures. These trends are known as Cellular 
    Automata, which can be generally described as ones in which members of a community respond to the states
    of those around them, leading to a change in the community as a whole over time.
